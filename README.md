Hello, I'm __Leslie Seeberger__--a fullstack developer living in Minnesota, USA. I've professional experience with C#, .Net, MSSQL, React, GraphQL,
JavaScript, and TypeScript, but I'm always up for learning something new.
Recently I've been focused on learning Elixir and have been working on personal projects using the PETAL stack.
